### Valorant weapons data fetcher
This web app fetches data from the [Valorant-API](https://valorant-api.com).
I made this just to practice data fetching from an API and to display the fetched data for the user.

## Improvements?
This app does not have the best structure codewise. It has few flaws. 
- Data fetching happens in App.js, not in a seperate file.
- Some code could be refactored.
- UI is not very appealing.
